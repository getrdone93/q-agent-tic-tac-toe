I developed this project in eclipse with the pydev plugin. So it is easiest to play the q agent if you import this project into eclipse as a pydev project. I am working on supporting CLI out of the box.

If you wish to play right away, then execute the play.py file.

If you wish to see the learning process take place, then execute the learn.py file. This will result in a new state.dat file. The state.dat file is a dictionary that contains the state action value pairs and frequencies. This dictionary is the "brain" of the q agent.
