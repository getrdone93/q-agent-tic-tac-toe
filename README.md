I developed this project in eclipse with the pydev plugin. So it is easiest to play the q agent if you import this project into eclipse as a pydev project.

If you wish to play right away, then execute the play.py file.

`python play.py`

If you wish to see the learning process take place, then execute the learn.py file. This will result in a new state.dat file. The state.dat file is a dictionary that contains the state action value pairs and frequencies. This dictionary is the "brain" of the q agent.

`python learn.py`
