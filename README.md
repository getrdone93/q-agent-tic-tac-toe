Try to beat the q-agent!

If you wish to play right away, then execute the play.py file.

`python play.py`

If you wish to see the learning process take place or if you are bored of playing the same q agent, then execute the learn.py file. This will result in a new state.dat file. The state.dat file is a dictionary that contains state action value pairs and frequencies. This dictionary is the "brain" of the q agent.

`python learn.py`
